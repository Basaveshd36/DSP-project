# DSP-project
Digital signal processing course project 
Design and implement a MATLAB GUI application that facilitates the recording, playback, denoising and waveform visualization of audio signals with speed knob
This project involves the development of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that helps users to manage and modify audiodata efficiently.The GUI is designed to record multiple audio files for a specific duration,providing users with playback options ,denoising capabilities(noise reduction),and representation of audio waveforms.
